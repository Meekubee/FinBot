# FinBot: AI Financial Analyst ðŸ¤–ðŸ’°

FinBot is an **AI-powered financial assistant** that provides intelligent, context-aware advice through a REST API.  
It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to deliver accurate and relevant answers.

When a user asks a question, the application first retrieves relevant documents from a **ChromaDB** vector knowledge base.  
This context, combined with the user's query, is then processed by a **multi-agent system** built with **Microsoft AutoGen** and powered by **Google's Gemini LLM**.  

The backend is built with **Python (FastAPI)** and uses **PostgreSQL** for user data management.
